## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My Idea is to create a poker game with a twist in it. At the start of every round the computer will generate three wild cards (EX. Ace of Spades, Jack of Clubs, 3 of Hearts). These 3 cards, if distributed to the players at the "table" will serve as any card in the game based on the players needs.
