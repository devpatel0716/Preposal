Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've coded like a rough understanding of the game. I would say its like 60-70% done. I added all of the hands in poker as functions and they would return True or False if the player for example, had a flush. I also coded the player action function which asks players to bet call check raise or fold. 


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I really want to encorporate graphics because right now its just a console project. I also want to try and make it so player 2's cards are hidden but the graphics is my main priority right now. I also want to add the wild card aspect if I have time. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

It's mainly little fixable problems like asking the other player to call or fold if the first player raises and like making the current bet = 0 every time a new bet round begins.
