# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Wild Hand Poker
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A replica of the poker game with wildcards!
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My Idea is to create a poker game with a twist in it. At the start of every round the computer will generate three wild cards (EX. Ace of Spades, Jack of Clubs, 3 of Hearts). These 3 cards, if distributed to the players at the "table" will serve as any card in the game based on the players needs. I'm most likely going to use pygame for the visuals and coding. My program would contain a lot of booleans that check for the best hands in the game and check if users have the wildcards!

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I think I'll be able to accomplish the visual aspects and make functions to check for most of the hands in Poker

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Accomplishing all the checks for the all 10 hands in POKER

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Accomplishing all the 10 hands and implementing the wild car twist. 

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I'll need to research more on how to visually implement the card game on pygame. Other than that I think everything is able to be accomplished with the skill set I have currently, and time.
